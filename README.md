# YoYo
Yo yo yo yo yo... yo yo? Yo yo yo yo! Yo!

## Requirements
YoYo runs on a server with discord 1.0.0. As long as there isn't a significant update past the current version (1.2.0a), then you're probably safe.
YoYo uses F-Strings, so 3.6 =< version is required.

## How to use?
Run the code with `python main.py` as you would normally. In the discord client, send the bot a DM of `!yo help`.
